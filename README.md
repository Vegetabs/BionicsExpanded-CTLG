# Bionics Expanded
*Bionics Expanded* (BE) is a content mod for *Cataclysm: The Last Generation* (CTLG), consisting of bionics which I just thought would be fun to create. 

## Content
The current implemented bionics include:
- Bio Accelerator Unit CBM
- Chemical Synthesis CBM
- Dragon's Breath CBM
- Drill Arms CBM
- Neural Overloader CBM
- Variable Dispersion Arrays CBM

## Installation Instructions
1. Download the src code in the latest mod release
2. Unzip the file in the 'data\mods' directory

## FAQ
- **Q1**: I'm trying to use the Dragon's Breath/VDA bionics, and it's saying, "Gas reserves are too low!" What do I do?
    - **A1**: All gas-based bionics require the ***Chemical Synthesizer*** bionic to function, as they utilise gas reserves within the user's body to function.
- **Q2**: Why is my character's health extremely low after synthesizing chemicals?
    - **A2**: Synthesizing chemicals is not free! It takes time, bionic power and reduces the user's health to simulate the bionic taking resources from the user's body.
- **Q3**: I've been blinded after turning on the VDA?!
    - **A3**: The VDA indiscriminately disperses chemicals into the surrounding area; this also includes ***your*** tile. To prevent being affected by your dispersed chemicals, consider using a gas mask or the ***Air Filtration System*** and ***Protective Lenses*** bionics.
- **Q4**: Why did [insert bionic] not do anything when I activated it?
    - **A4**: This could be a range of things, such as not having sufficient bionic power, sufficient gas reserves, or the bionic's behavior changing due to a previous action. If you're using the VDA or Chemical Synthesizer, the bionic will behave differently if you have a current order active, so make sure to check the message log to see if it's canceling your current order. If none of these apply, please create a GitHub issue or notify me directly.
